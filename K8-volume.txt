kubernetes volumes:
2 types of volumes
EBS:Elastic blob storage
EFS:elastic file system

google drive works on NFS protocol. (network file sharing)

1. static provisioning 
2. dynamic provisioning


static provisioning
____________
EBS:(elastic block storage)
1.
volume create at 10 mins

need to install csi drive in the cluster, as cluster shuold connect for ebs volume know
2.
kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver/deploy/kubernetes/overlays/stable/?ref=release-1.32"

kubectl get ns
kubectl get pods -n kube-system (you must see the admin details, as csi controller info post installing csi drivers)(kube system have admin things)

3.
your nodes should have access to connect with ebs volume. ebscsi policy need to attach to the eks cluster nodes

4. 
wrappers:
you can represent ebs volume inside k8s with a resource called "persistent volume". this is eqivalent to ebs storage inside k8 cluster. this is admin level

PVC:
persistent volume claim. Pods should claim i want the volume.pods can claim the volume through resource called pvc.this is user level

_____________________________
important note: if you stopped the cluster and when you craete again the cluster nodes will change and the nodes have not the of the role is ebscsidriver policy. 
which we have to attach the policy again whenever nodes get changes.
___________________________

k8s-access modes:
read-write-once: we cant connect hard disk to multiple devices at a time, similarly ebs also works as hard disk so access mode read-write-once

Dynamic provisioning:
___________________
1.
volume create at 10 mins

need to install csi drive in the cluster, as cluster shuold connect for rbs volume know
2.
kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver/deploy/kubernetes/overlays/stable/?ref=release-1.32"
3.
someone on behalf of you should create volume and equivalent pv in k8s. this can be done by storage class in k8s

retain,recycle,delete
4.

static provisioning:
kid-->mother-->father-->money
pod-->pvc-->pv-->storage

dynamic provioning:
kid-->mother-->e wallets -->money
pod-->pvc-->storage class --> storage

ebs vs efs
____________
1. ebs is like hard disk, volume and instance should be in one AZ
2. efs is through nfs protocal , it can be anywhere
3. ebs volume is static, it cant increase by its won
4. efs is completely dynami, it can automatically expand. which is suitable for DB applications like mysql. ebs have less latency.

ebs is good for db like mysql as data no need to travel , volume and pod will be same network or AZ.
efs is good for images and videos


EFS:
----------------------------
a. Static provisoning:

1. need to create efs volume in aws account 
2. allow ec2 instaces on nfs protocol in efs sg
( means have to copy the cluster nodes sg id and add the inbound rule of your efs sg on nfs protocol and paste your sg id)
3. install drivers , efs drivers
4. check iam access on ec2 instances
installation of efs driver:

kubectl kustomize \
    "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-efs-csi-driver/deploy/kubernetes/overlays/stable/ecr/?ref=release-2.0" > private-ecr-driver.yaml
	
	kubectl apply -f private-ecr-driver.yaml
	
5. add the policy of efscsi

LB:>node on particular port-->node should allow traffic from LB --> nodeport -->cluster IP-->Pod

b. dynamic provision :
------------------
1. installi efs csi drivers
2. check ec2 nodes shouls have efs csi role permission
3. storage EFS volume
4. check efs sg allowing ec2 sg
5 create sc


implementing expese with volumes_________
1. install ebs csi drivers
2 . ec2 nodes permisions


Admin team created sc and name space, drivers inastalled and permissions given to node.
