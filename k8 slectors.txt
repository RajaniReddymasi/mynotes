imagepullpolicy:
node have  nginx:latest imagepullpolicy
you have updated the image as nginx:alpha
so if nodes should pull the changes each time means we have to select imagepullpolicy as always

Taint:
-----------
 kubectl taint nodes ip-192-168-12-185.ec2.internal project=expense:NoSchedule
  kubectl label nodes ip-192-168-12-185.ec2.internal project=expense

Tolerations are applied to pods. Tolerations allow the scheduler to schedule pods with matching taints. 
Tolerations allow scheduling but don't guarantee scheduling: the scheduler also evaluates other parameters as part of its function.

Affinity:

affinity = like

1. schedule -- scheduler schedules the pod
2. execution --pod should run

preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution --> soft
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution --> hard

ip-192-168-42-153.ec2.internal --> tained with project exepense

labelled also with project exepense
1. Node effinity

requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution --> pod will not run even you set affinity. 
we need to apply tolerations. So in this case until you apply toleration pod will be in pending state

preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution --> scheduler tries the asked node, 
but it cant schedule because tainted node. since it is only preferred it can schedule on to differnt node


2. Pod affinity:
