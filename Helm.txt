HPA: Horizontal pod autoscalling: Based on the resource definition if cpu is 20% used the accoring to you hpa scripts pods will scale up

autoscalling 
autoscalling policy
CPU
a pod is over utilized or less utilized based on resource definition

1. metric server
2. resource definition in pod

we have to give the resources in the spec

 spec:
      containers:
      - name: frontend
        image: joindevops/frontend:v1.0
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "100m"
            memory: "128Mi"
          limits:
            cpu: "150m"
            memory: "256Mi"
