Kubernetes Scenario-Based Interview Questions

Cluster Management and Architecture:
____________________________________

1. Scenario: Your Kubernetes control plane crashed. How would you investigate and restore the cluster?

Control Plane Crash
1. Investigate: Check logs, error messages and system status.
2. Identify the cause: Hardware failure, software issue or configuration error.
3. Restore:
    1. Reboot or replace faulty nodes.
    2. Reconfigure or update software.
    3. Restore from backups.


2. Scenario: You need to set up a multi-node Kubernetes cluster with high availability. What architectural considerations will you take into account?
Multi-Node Cluster Setup
1. High availability: Multiple master nodes, load balancing.
2. Scalability: Auto-scaling, horizontal pod scaling.
3. Security: Network policies, encryption.
4. Monitoring: Logging, metrics, alerting.


3. Scenario: One of your worker nodes is not joining the cluster. How would you debug the issue?
Worker node issues:
1. Investigate: Check node status, logs and network connectivity.
2. Debug:
    1. Verify node configuration.
    2. Check network policies.
    3. Inspect kubelet logs.

Networking and Ingress

4. Scenario: How would you expose multiple services using a single IP with different paths (e.g., /service1 and /service2)?

Exposing Multiple Services
1. Ingress resource with multiple paths.
2. Service mesh (e.g., Istio).
3. API Gateway (e.g., NGINX).

5. Scenario: A Pod cannot communicate with another Pod in a different namespace. How will you troubleshoot it?

Pod Communication
1. Verify network policies.
2. Check service and pod configurations.
3. Inspect kube-proxy logs.


6. Scenario: How would you restrict certain services to be accessible only within the cluster?

Restricting Service Access
1. Network policies.
2. Service annotations (e.g., cluster.local).
3. Kubernetes Network Policies.

Storage Management

7. Scenario: Your application requires persistent storage. How would you configure it in Kubernetes?
Persistent Storage
1. Persistent Volumes (PVs).
2. StatefulSets or Deployments.
3. StorageClass configuration.


8. Scenario: A Pod using a Persistent Volume gets stuck in the Pending state. What steps would you take to resolve the issue?
Pending Persistent Volume
1. Investigate: Check PV and PVC status.
2. Resolve:
    1. Verify storage class configuration.
    2. Inspect kube-controller-manager logs.


9. Scenario: How would you ensure data redundancy in a Kubernetes cluster?
Data Redundancy
1. Replicate data across multiple nodes.
2. Use distributed storage solutions (e.g., Ceph).
3. Regular backups.

Security and Access Control

10. Scenario: You need to allow a specific namespace to pull images from a private Docker registry. How would you configure it?
Private Docker Registry

1. Create a Kubernetes secret.
2. Configure Docker registry credentials.
3. Update Deployment/ Pod configuration.


11. Scenario: How would you create and manage role-based access controls (RBAC) for multiple teams using the same Kubernetes cluster?
Role-Based Access Control

1. Define roles and cluster roles.
2. Create role bindings.
3. Use Kubernetes RBAC.

12. Scenario: A developer reports unauthorized access to a resource. How would you audit and secure the cluster?
Unauthorized Access

1. Investigate: Audit logs and system events.
2. Secure:
    1. Update RBAC configurations.
    2. Restrict network access.

5. Workload Management and Deployment Strategies

13. Scenario: How would you deploy an application in a rolling update fashion while minimizing downtime?
Rolling Update

1. Use Deployments with rolling update strategy.
2. Configure maxSurge and maxUnavailable.
3. Monitor rollout status.


14. Scenario: You need to deploy a new version of an application but need the ability to quickly revert if there are issues. How would you implement this?
Quick Revert
1. Use canary releases or blue-green deployments.
2. Configure rollbacks.
3. Monitor application performance.

15. Scenario: If a Pod becomes unresponsive during deployment, how would you identify and resolve the problem?
Unresponsive Pod

1. Investigate: Check pod logs and system events.
2. Resolve:
    1. Verify pod configuration.
    2. Inspect kubelet logs.
____________________________________________________________

6. Autoscaling and Resource Management

16. Scenario: How would you configure autoscaling for an application based on CPU and memory usage?
Autoscaling

1. Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA).
2. Configure CPU and memory thresholds.
3. Monitor scaling events.

17. Scenario: Your application experiences unpredictable traffic spikes. How would you optimize resource allocation?
Resource Optimization
1. Use Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA).
2. Configure resource requests and limits.
3. Monitor resource utilization.


18. Scenario: What would you do if a Pod consumes more resources than allocated, causing other applications to slow down?
Resource Starvation

1. Investigate: Check resource utilization.
2. Resolve:
    1. Update resource requests and limits.
    2. Configure Quality of Service (QoS).
